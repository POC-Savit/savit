## Project Overview

**Savit** is an interactive and educational platform designed to teach users important financial knowledge tailored to their age group through an engaging gaming experience. The platform provides personalized financial guidelines based on current economic conditions, making it easier for users to understand and apply essential financial concepts.

## Key Features

- **Age-Specific Guidelines:** Savit offers tailored financial guidelines to users based on their age cohort. This ensures that the information is relevant and appropriate for each stage of life.
  
- **Economic Insights:** The platform provides up-to-date financial knowledge that reflects the current economic situation. Users will learn essential financial skills that are timely and practical.

- **Character Customization:** Users can personalize their in-game characters by earning credits through savings. These credits can be spent in the in-game shop to purchase items and customize their characters, adding a fun and rewarding aspect to the learning process.

## How It Works

1. **Engage in Interactive Games:** Users participate in games that are designed to teach financial principles in a fun and engaging way.
2. **Learn and Earn:** As users progress through the game, they earn credits based on their in-game savings, which are tied to real-world financial concepts.
3. **Customize Your Character:** Users can use the credits they've earned to buy items from the in-game shop and customize their characters, making their learning experience both educational and enjoyable.
